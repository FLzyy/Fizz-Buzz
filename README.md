## What is Fizz-Buzz?
Usually used as a test by people hiring programmers to see a person's coding style and their general ingenuity, it states to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz", if divisible by both print "FizzBuzz".

## Why make this?
Honestly no reason, just want to make random stuff.
